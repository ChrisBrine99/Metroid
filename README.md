# Metroid

A personal project of mine that I would call a "faithful reimagining" of Metroid II: Return of Samus for the original Game Boy. Since I wish to make my own Metroidvania-style game in the near future, I felt it best to start by recreating a game form the series that created the genre to begin with.

This project takes elements from many games in the metroid series. For example, the physics are loosely based on Metroid: Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion's physics engines to give the game smooth and responsive controls. The beam swapping system is inspired by a very similar system found in the Metroid Prime trilogy. The enemies are taken from both the original Metroid and Metroid II; with updated AI based on later games in the series. Finally, items from future Metroid games like the Gravity Suit, Super Missiles, and Power Bombs have been added into the game in their own 8-bit forms.

The .zip file is a playable demo of the latest version of the game. Have fun!
